In diablo 2 LOD and D2R weapons with the 'Grinding' prefix can be sold and bought back for a gold profit. This script assumes the user has such a weapon equipped and automates the purchase flow.


Steps to run

1 - Download MPOS or any other software that helps you located the relative coordinates of your cursor to determine the locations of the in-game Sell Button, the coordinates of where you will need to click to interact
with your equiped weapon, and the coordinates of where you will need to interact to buy the weapon back

2- Replace the coordinate variables in the script to align with the ones for your screen

3- In terminal, navigate to the path of the scrip and type "python d2pyautogui.py" and enjoy



NOTE- All modding/scripting projects like this need to be done on offline characters where the TOS is more lax to projects/learning.
